#  Homework 1.6

This homework will help you practice working with lines in slope-intercept form (`y=mx +b`) in preparation for our next lab.

If you need a refresher on slope-intercept form of a line, you can watch this [Khan Academy video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:forms-of-linear-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:intro-to-slope-intercept-form/a/introduction-to-slope-intercept-form).

**💻 Write the functions in `hw_01_06.py` and run `test_homework.py` in Terminal to check your work!**
